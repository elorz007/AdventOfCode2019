# configurable rules can be customized from this configuration file
# binary rules can set their severity level
# force_cast: warning # implicitly. Give warning only for force casting

# force_try:
#   severity: warning # explicitly. Give warning only for force try

# type_body_length:
#   - 300 # warning
#   - 400 # error

# or they can set both explicitly
# file_length:
#   warning: 500
#   error: 800

# large_tuple: # warn user when using 3 values in tuple, give error if there are 4
#    - 3
#    - 4
   
# naming rules can set warnings/errors for min_length and max_length
# additionally they can set excluded names
# type_name:
#   min_length: 4 # only warning
#   max_length: # warning and error
#     warning: 30
#     error: 35
#   excluded: iPhone # excluded via string
# reporter: "xcode"
